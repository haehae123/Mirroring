CodingVersionID indicates the person who coded them in our system.
The category codes are below.  The predator coding is 200, 600, 900.  Victim coding is 210,610,910

Predators frequently attempt to build relationships with their victims in several ways. They attempt to uncover psychological weaknesses for exploitation, namely poor familial relationships, weak friendship networks, and a willingness to divulge personal contact information.  They also attempt to “connect” with their victims through showing an interest in the same activities that the youths like and by purporting to share the same values and attitudes about topics of discussion. The Personal Information category is designed to capture these exchanges.

(200/210) Personal Information is defined as the exchange of information about demographic details, personal relationships, tastes, and values, and the activities they like to participate in.  Specifically, use this code for lines that contain any of the examples below:

Demographic details: Race, ethnicity, age, gender, name, screen-names, hometowns, school, workplace, email address, home address, phone number, profile information, facial appearance (excluding all other body parts), exchange of personal (excluding nude and / or sexually-themed) photos. 

Values: Religious views, political views, personal values, and personal tastes, likes and dislikes concerning the topic of discussion (excluding sexual content, relationships with older men).

Relationships: Attitudes, values or ambivalence about, desire for, interest in, avoidance or lack of romantic relationships (excluding discussion about sexual experience or orientation),  familial relationships, and friendships (online or in person). 

Activities: Mention or discussion about activities that the predator or victim like to do, general inquiries about what the predator/victim is currently doing (excluding sexual activities and innuendo), like to do or like to do for fun when there is no sexual content or sexual context. 




Predators also attempt to determine their victims’ tolerance for, and comfort with, discussing sex-related topics, exchanging sexual images, and using sexual (or obscene) language in general. Over time, this strategy can also desensitize victims to this language and to the inappropriateness of having these discussions with older men (and women).  Predators also use innuendoes and other plays on words to reframe or even mask their true intentions from their victims and from adults who may be monitoring them. The Grooming category is designed to capture these overt and subtle sexual exchanges. This category is considered to be more advanced, and therefore potentially more dangerous, than the Personal Information category. *In those instances when a line contains both personal information and grooming language, code the line as grooming.*

(600/610) Grooming is the discussion of sex (overtly, through innuendo, or reframing) and the use of obscenities, sexual terms, and the intentional sexualized misspelling of commonplace words in sexual and non-sexual contexts. Specifically, use this code for lines that contain any of the examples below:

Sexual activities: mention or discussion of sexual activities through the use of overt language and innuendo circumcision, penis and /or breast size and appearance. Finally, use this code for the transmission of nude photos / images of the predator/victim. Also use this code for mention or discussion of sexual orientation, virginity, predator/victim masturbating. 

Sexual attitudes: predator/victim’s liking, preference, or attitudes about sex acts. Also use this code for mention of or discussion about age differences between predator/victim and for victim’s age preferences in relationships and their willingness to experiment or speculate about sexual acts.

Sexual organs:  penis and /or breast size and appearance, circumcision, piercing, the transmission of nude/sexualized photos / images of these body parts.

Physical intimacy: the mention of or discussion about hugging, kissing, intimate touching, stroking and sexual acts. Also use this code for the intentional sexualized misspelling of commonplace words. 

Sexual language: obscenities and innuendos when discussing anything, sexual or not. This also includes the sexualized misspellings of commonplace words.




Ultimately, predators want to meet with victims for sexual encounters.  The communicative process used by predators for setting up the meeting is called isolation and approach.  Usually preying upon information gleaned during personal information exchanges, predators exploit their victims’ weak relationships by isolating them from family and friends and from other authority figures who may interfere with the sexual encounter (police, counselors, neighbors, other adults, etc.). Predators also determine the presence or absence of these other authority figures during their approach discussions in order to elude detection and arrest. The Approach category  is designed to capture these exchanges.  This category is considered to be the most advanced category and is more dangerous than the Personal Information and Grooming categories. *In those instances when a line contains both Approach language and language from Personal information and/or Grooming categories, code the line as Approach.*

(900/910) Approach is defined as predators attempting to meet victims, attempting to determine whether or not the victims are adults or police, and attempting to isolate  victims from family and friends.  Specifically, use this code for lines that contain any of the examples below:

Meeting: mention of or discussion about meeting in person, including statements or requests for meeting time and references to “coming over.” Includes language asking the victim to speak on the telephone and for specific requests for victim’s location, address, and pictures to identify the victim.

Location: mention of or discussion about the physical location of the victim’s friends and /or family, the address and location of the meeting location.

Isolation: mention of or discussion about concealing (or lying about) the conversation or meeting plans from parents, friends, teachers, police and others. Also use this code for mention of or discussion about the victim’s activities or plans when home alone. Also includes mentions of or discussion about the predator/victim’s possible identity as a police officer and the possibility of getting in trouble for participating in the conversation.
